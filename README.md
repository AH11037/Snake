# Snake
![Something funny idk](assets/SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE.gif)</br>
This was a **HORRIBLE** joke</br>
## About
A simple snake game built with Pygame. Collect points, avoid running into yourself, choose your difficulty, dodge walls (in a certain 🗿 gamemode), and see how long you can survive!
## Downloading & Installation
1. Download the `.exe` file from **Releases**. This time, I saved you the hassle of downloading Python or Pygame.
2. Double-click & play
   * Notes: The `.exe` has a known bug that will make it show an error message when you quit. It shouldn't cause any damage.
4. Rage-quit (optional)
## Controls
* **Arrow keys**: Move the snake
* **Enter**: Select option (only used in the main menu)
* **Esc/ Close the window**: Quit the game
## Menu Options
* **Easy, Medium & Hard**: Different levels of speed
* 🗿: Hardcore mode with walls appearing
* **Quit**: Leaves the game before you embarrass yourself
## What I Learned
* Building a full game loop with Pygame
* Using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to structure code:
  * `Snake`, `Fruit` & `Wall` classes
  * These classes handle their respective behaviours
* Handling user input and menu navigation
* Managing game state: score, difficulty and wall generation
* Using `pygame.time.Clock` to control FPS and difficulty scaling
* Displaying graphics and text dynamically
## Future Improvements
* Add sound effects
* Create a high-score system
* Add power-ups or bonus items
* Allow customizable snake colors or skins
* Add pause and resume functionality
* Add a retry function (is this honestly going to be a common trend?)
